# üéì MentorHIT ‚Äì AI-Based Academic and Career Advisor for HIT Students

MentorHIT is the AI mentor every student wishes they had. Built for the Holon Institute of Technology (HIT), MentorHIT helps students plan their academic journey and professional path based on real data, not guesswork.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Academic students often face challenges such as:

- Choosing elective courses that align with their academic strengths and career aspirations
- Finding relevant job opportunities during or after their studies
- Receiving only generic advice from traditional counseling services

Even with available tools like advisors, forums, and job boards, students:

- Struggle to personalize the information they receive
- Avoid bureaucratic or uncomfortable advisory conversations
- Miss out on critical opportunities because no one highlighted them in time

---

## üîç Understanding Students‚Äô Needs

At HIT, students frequently ask themselves:

- Which courses will truly move me forward?
- What specialization is right for me?
- How can I translate my skills into a real-world job?
- How do I plan a career‚Äînot just complete a degree?

---

## üìä Research-Based Justification

A study by the **Strada Education Network** found that:

- Only **1 in 5 students** receives quality career guidance during their studies
- **69%** of those who did were employed in jobs requiring a degree
- **87%** reported it improved their personal well-being
- **73%** said it helped them reach their goals

This highlights a large gap between the need for guidance and the resources currently available.
